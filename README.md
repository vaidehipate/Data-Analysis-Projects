# Data Analysis Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects implemented in Python. Each project focuses on different aspects of data analysis, visualization, and prediction.

## Projects

1. **Demographic Data Analyzer**
    - File: [demographic_data_analyzer.py](demographic_data_analyzer.py)
    - Description: This project analyzes demographic data, providing insights into various demographic statistics such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and correlation.

2. **Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation Calculator**
    - File: [mean_var_std.py](mean_var_std.py)
    - Description: This project calculates the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a given dataset, providing statistical measures of central tendency and dispersion.

3. **Medical Data Visualizer**
    - File: [medical_data_visualizer.py](medical_data_visualizer.py)
    - Description: This project visualizes medical data using various plotting techniques, enabling the exploration and understanding of medical datasets.

4. **Sea Level Predictor**
    - File: [sea_level_predictor.py](sea_level_predictor.py)
    - Description: This project predicts future sea levels based on historical data, employing regression techniques to model the relationship between time and sea level.

5. **Time Series Visualizer**
    - File: [time_series_visualizer.py](time_series_visualizer.py)
    - Description: This project focuses on visualizing time series data, allowing for the analysis of trends, seasonality, and patterns over time.

## Getting Started

To run any of the projects, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can then download the respective Python file(s) and execute them using a Python interpreter. Additionally, ensure that any required libraries mentioned within the files are installed.

## Usage

Each project file can be run independently. Simply execute the Python script using the command line or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
